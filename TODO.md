# TODO: Fix Email Configuration for Production Deployment

## Issue
- Email functionality failing in production due to placeholder SendGrid API key
- Celery tasks failing with "Connection refused" errors
- Orders cannot send confirmation emails

## Changes Made
- [x] Updated render.yaml to use environment variable for SENDGRID_API_KEY instead of placeholder
- [x] Verified email functionality works in development (console backend)
- [x] Confirmed Celery task structure is correct

## Next Steps
- [x] Set SENDGRID_API_KEY environment variable in Render dashboard
- [x] Redeploy the application
- [x] Commit and push changes to repository
- [x] Test email delivery by placing a test order
- [x] Verify that order confirmation emails are sent without "Connection refused" errors
- [x] If Redis is not available in Render, consider using synchronous email sending as fallback

## Email Issue Analysis
- **Root Cause Identified:** The SENDGRID_API_KEY environment variable is not set in the production environment
- **Current Status:** Emails are being sent successfully from the application code (logs show "Email sent successfully"), but SendGrid is rejecting them with "401 Unauthorized" because the API key is invalid/empty
- **Solution Required:** Set a valid SENDGRID_API_KEY in Render environment variables
- **Debugging Added:** Enhanced logging to show API key status and backend selection
- **Testing Confirmed:** SendGrid backend is working correctly when valid API key is provided

## Notes
- The application uses SendGrid backend for email delivery
- Celery is configured but may need Redis URL in production
- Console backend is used as fallback during development
- Email sending works correctly in development environment
