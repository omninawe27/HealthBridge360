## Next Steps
1. **Configure Gmail SMTP credentials on Render:**
   - Go to Render dashboard
   - Navigate to your service environment variables
   - Set up Gmail app password (not regular password)
   - Update these environment variables:
     - `EMAIL_HOST_USER`: Your Gmail address
     - `EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD`: Gmail app password
     - `DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL`: Your Gmail address

2. **Test email delivery:**
   - Deploy changes to Render
   - Test checkout process
   - Verify emails are received by users and pharmacists

## Gmail Setup Instructions
1. Enable 2-factor authentication on your Gmail account
2. Generate an app password: https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833
3. Use the app password (not your regular password) for `EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD`

## Alternative SMTP Providers
If Gmail doesn't work, consider:
- SendGrid (paid plan)
- Mailgun
- Amazon SES
- Any other SMTP provider

## Testing
- Local testing will fail with auth errors (expected)
- On Render, emails should work once proper credentials are configured
