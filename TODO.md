# TODO: Fix Email Configuration for Production Deployment

## Issue
- Email functionality failing in production due to placeholder SendGrid API key
- Celery tasks failing with "Connection refused" errors
- Orders cannot send confirmation emails

## Changes Made
- [x] Updated render.yaml to use environment variable for SENDGRID_API_KEY instead of placeholder
- [x] Verified email functionality works in development (console backend)
- [x] Confirmed Celery task structure is correct

## Next Steps
- [x] Set SENDGRID_API_KEY environment variable in Render dashboard
- [x] Redeploy the application
- [ ] Test email delivery by placing a test order
- [ ] Verify that order confirmation emails are sent without "Connection refused" errors
- [ ] If Redis is not available in Render, consider using synchronous email sending as fallback

## Notes
- The application uses SendGrid backend for email delivery
- Celery is configured but may need Redis URL in production
- Console backend is used as fallback during development
- Email sending works correctly in development environment
